Todo List allows users to create a user account by logging in and enter and save todo items. 

I built this app to practice using Javascript classes and to learn how to use firebase firestore and authentication. Bonus! I got to learn a little about webpack too. I'm still pretty unclear about it's use but I made it work and can at least navigte the documentation without too much swearing.
